    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h4> What the hell is this site?</h4>
    <p>This is my <strong>not</strong> my first website. It is however my 'first' in terms of <em>actually</em> trying to learn HTML as well as other languages.
        I want to learn more and more, and I'll probably use this page as a means of updating my learning status -- A personal blog of some sorts.
    </p>
    <h4>So what do you plan on doing with this site?</h4>
    <p>Well... I do plan on turning it into a sort of <strong>personal blog</strong> as I said before.</p>
    <p>I want to have a page which just has journal entry-like posts about my progress, as well as a page with short reviews about things I've experienced recently</p>
